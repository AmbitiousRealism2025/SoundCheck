## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend**
- **React + TypeScript** with Vite for fast development
- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS** for modern, consistent styling
- **Responsive Design** with mobile-first approach

### **Backend**
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** database with Drizzle ORM
- **Passport.js** with OpenID Connect for authentication
- **Session management** with secure httpOnly cookies

### **Key Files**
- `shared/schema.ts` - Type-safe data models and validation schemas
- `server/routes.ts` - RESTful API endpoints with user scoping
- `server/storage.ts` - Database abstraction layer
- `server/replitAuth.ts` - Authentication configuration
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Main application interface
- `client/src/components/calendar-view.tsx` - Calendar integration
- `client/src/components/earnings-tracker.tsx` - Earnings dashboard

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js environment (configured via Replit)
- PostgreSQL database (available via Replit)

### **Running the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run mobile-specific tests
npm run test:mobile

# View test report
npm run test:report
```

**Note**: Tests require a DATABASE_URL environment variable to be set

### **Environment Variables**
Required environment variables (managed by Replit):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS` - Allowed domains for authentication
- `ISSUER_URL` - OIDC provider endpoint (optional, defaults to Replit OIDC)

## 🎯 **What's Next**

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **✅ Authentication Verification**: callbackURL fix analyzed and verified - system is ready for testing
2. **📋 Final Quality Assurance**: End-to-end testing of all major user flows
3. **🚀 Production Deployment**: Deploy to Replit environment with proper configuration

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **📊 Advanced Analytics**: 
   - Revenue trends and forecasting
   - Performance metrics per venue
   - Monthly/yearly earning comparisons

2. **🔄 Enhanced Calendar Features**:
   - External calendar sync (Google Calendar, iCal import)
   - Recurring event templates
   - Travel time calculations

3. **👥 Collaboration Features**:
   - Band/group management
